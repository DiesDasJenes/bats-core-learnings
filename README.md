# Learnings from using bats-core

In this repository I want to collect my recent learnings on bats-core and bats-mock from the user grayhemp. Although their documentation is great some parts are missing around bats-mock. The readme itself doesn't explain much. I have found different examples of bats-mock usage that worked and I want to summarize them here.
